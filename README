"COBE" (COmpilation By Evolution) is an experimental retargetable code
generator based on genetic algorithms.

This program has been used in the investigation of novel code generation
methods that are able to produce optimized code for application-specific
processors with instruction-level parallelism and complex instructions,
while being sufficiently generic to support design exploration and
design evaluation in a hardware/software codesign system.

The code generator has been developed in C# using a beta version of
Microsoft's .NET framework; therefore the code does not use any of the
features introduced in more recent versions of that language.  You can
use any version of the .NET Framework SDK or Mono to compile it.
